# Intro
- Build your application in C/C++.
- MAES breaks your monolithic application into services, which are then loosely connected via APIs. This allows for improved scalability, better fault isolation, and faster time to market.
- MAES's messaging function is based on ZMQ, a light messaging library. MAES supports for 2 service communication methods, PUB/SUB and REQ/RESP
- Easy for Two-Pizza Development Teams.
